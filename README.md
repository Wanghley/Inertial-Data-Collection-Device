>  printed circuit board and code for collecting inertial data to research purposes of movements.

## About
Hardware developed to collect inertial data of humans (i.e. Accelerometer, Giroscope) and temperature in order to provide an open source hardware for researchs related to the analysis of human movements for many purposes.<br>
This project was tested in the diagnosis and prognosis of neuromotor diseases - Parkinson's disease mostly as part of the project of scientific research [**"Visualization Strategies to Online Big Data applied in individualized medicine"**](https://github.com/Wanghley/PIBIC-Strategies-Data-Visualization-Medicine).

## Development
In order to run and contribute to the PCB development you must have **Eagle**  installed in your computer and then use the .sch to work on the circuit itself and the .brd to work in the layout design.

Now, for the development under de code of hardware control you must have Arduino IDE or similar to work on the .ino code.
